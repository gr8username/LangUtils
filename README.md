Source code for basic translation and dictionary add-on for Anki that I've created.
Eventually, more features that I find useful may be added. 

For right now, it supports the following features...
1. Translation using Simplytranslate instance (which uses Google Translate)
2. Dictionary lookup using reverso's online dictionary.
3. Easily adding translated phrases as well as example phrases from reverso to cards.
